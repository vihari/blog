<p>This paper explores the potential of features generated by Convolutional Neural Network by using the features learned by Overfeat model for object classification task in ILSVRC13.  <br />
The features are appllied for various tasks such as <em>object classification, fine-grained recognition, scene recognition, attribute detection (for example attributes of pedestrians from a cam feed that is if they are wearing a hat, shoe, trouser, jeans etc.) and scene retrieval</em>.</p>

<h3 id="object-recognition">Object recognition</h3>

<p>Is the task of assigning labels (possibly more than one) to a given image. <br />
Since the features used are learned over a similar task, better results are expected. <br />
They tried on PASCAL VOM and MIT indoor dataset both of which are considered harder than ImageNet.  <br />
The mean Average Precision(mAP) over all the classes on PASCAL VOM is 77.2, which is 7 point more than second best. <br />
Thing to note is that, Oquab et.al. fixes all the layers trained on ImageNet and then it adds and optimized two fully-connected layers on VOC dataset with <strong>77.7</strong> mAP.</p>

<h3 id="object-detection">Object Detection</h3>

<p>This is about recognising and also putting a box around the object.<br />
With off-the-shelf features: <strong>46.2</strong> mAP (Girshick et.al.) and when fine-tuned on PASCAL VOC it is <strong>53.1</strong>.</p>

<p>The graph below summarizes the contribution of this paper.</p>

<h2 id="decafdecaf"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.1531v1.pdf">DeCAF</a></h2>

<p>This work is quite similar to the above one. <br />
The features are extracted from the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf" title="ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. ">AlexNet</a> which contains 5 convolutional layers (not inluding pooling) followed b7y two fully connnected layers.  <br />
Features are extracted from the output of 5th, 6th and 7th layer; notice that 7th is last but one layer and 5th has only convolutional layers. <br />
AlexNet has dropout in layers 6 and 7. <br />
Experiments were carried on the tasks of Object detection, fine-grained recognition, domain adaptation and scene recognition.</p>

<h3 id="object-recognition-1">Object Recognition</h3>

<p>It is found in their experiments that logistic Regression or linear SVM on these features already beat methods that involve task-specific features with SVM using multiple kernels by around 2-3% on mean accuracy.<br />
Things to note, the mean accuracy was around 33% when the training set contains only one example per class. <br />
<em>The performance of the system on 7th level features is slightly less (by 2%) when compared to 6th level feature.</em><br />
Dropout on layers: 6/7 improves perf. by 0-2%.<br />
This method beats two-layer convolution network trained on only the task-specific training data by 20%.</p>

<h2 id="frustratingly-easy-domain-adaptationeasyadapt"><a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume07easyadapt.pdf" title="Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation">Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation</a></h2>

<p>This is a 2007 paper that propses a simple pre-processing trick for easy adaptation. <br />
The DeCAF paper reports best results in the task of domain adaptation from Amazon images -&gt; webcam images using the features from AlexNet and this method. <br />
That interested me to study this further.<br />
Let me start with the simple code.</p>

<p>Consider the case where there is a loads of data in one domain but is different from the domain that we want to use it in. <br />
For example, we might want a PoS tagger trained on NewsWire to work on hardware blogs. <br />
That is, we have data from source domain and some amount of data from target domain; there are sevearal standard ways to adapt in such a case. <br />
According to the author, these approaches are surprisingly hard to beat.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SRCOnly: A single model is trained on only data from source data alone ignoring target data.</li>
  <li>TGTOnly: Model trained only on target data alone</li>
  <li>ALL: A model is trained on both the source and target domain. <br />
Can wash away the effects of target data since it is small relatively.<br />
For this reason, the source data eaxamples are weighed down by that factor to bring balance. <br />
WEIGHT is our next baseline which chooses the scaling factor of source examples by CV.</li>
  <li>PRED: Use the output of model trained on SRC data as feature for training on target domain.</li>
  <li>LinINT: Linearly interpolate the predictions of src and target models while the interpolation params are from dev. data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two models are found to have beat these:</p>
